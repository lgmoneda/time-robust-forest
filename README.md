A Proof of concept model that explores timestamp information to train a random forest with better Out of Distribution generalization power.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U time-robust-forest
```

## How to use it

There are a classifier and a regressor under `time_robust_forest.models`. They follow the sklearn interface, which means you can quickly fit and use a model:

```python
from time_robust_forest.models import TimeForestClassifier

features = ["x_1", "x_2"]
time_column = "periods"
target = "y"

model.fit(training_data[features + [time_column]], training_data[target])
predictions = model.predict_proba(test_data[features])[:, 1]
```

There are only a few arguments that differ from a traditional Random Forest. two arguments

- time_column: the column from the input dataframe containing the time
periods the model will iterate over to find the best splits (default: "period")
- min_sample_periods: the number of examples in every period the model needs
to keep while it splits.
- period_criterion: how the performance in every period is going to be
aggregated. Options: {"avg": average, "max": maximum, the worst case}.
(default: "avg")

### Make sure you have a good choice for the time column

Don't simply use a timestamp column from the dataset, make it discrete before and guarantee there is a reasonable amount of data points in every period. Example: use year if you have 3+ years of data. Notice the choice to make it discrete becomes a modeling choice you can optimize.
